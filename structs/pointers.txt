Turn addrss into value with *address
Turn value into address with &value


In go if our receivers have a pointer inside of it go will automatically turn variable into 
a pointer for you

example:
jim is passed by reference
func (pointerToPerson *person) updateName(newFirstName string) {
	(*pointerToPerson).firstName = newFirstName
}

func main() {
	jim := person{
		firstName: "Jim",
		lastName:  "billy",
		contact: contactInfo{
			email:   "Marcus@gmail.com",
			zipCode: 13377,
		},
	}
	jim.updateName("jimmy")
	jim.print()

}
