We know that...
Every value has a type
Every function has to specify the type of its arguments

so does that mean...
Every function we ever write has to be rewritten to accomodate different
types even if the logic in it is the same?

Interfaces make it easier to reuse code..

can not create a direct value from struct interface type
Interfaces are implicit
